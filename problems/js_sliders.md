# Time Management

Work / sleep balance is a well-known problem for CS students. Build a tool that
helps students visualize their time allocation.

You are given a page with two sliders, with IDs `slider1` and `slider2`. You
are to implement the function `updateSliderValues(slider)` that is called when
the user changes one of the slider values. Your function should update the
other slider, so that the values of both sliders add up to 100%. The `slider`
parameter is the number (1 or 2) of the slider changed by the user. Sliders are
implemented as HTML5 range inputs with values ranging from 0 to 100.
