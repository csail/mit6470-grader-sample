# CSS Selector

Make the text inside the `<p>` elements green. Keep in mind that the test page
has the CSS fragment below following your CSS, so you will have to find a way
to override it.

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Also keep in mind that the grading endpoint does not allow submitted CSS to
contain `!important`.
